# reactCourse

## Start.

Initially
    npm install

Then launch in one cmd
    npm run start
and
    webpack
in another.

It launches node web server with hot reloading support.

## Modes

Application has two modes : production and development.
For toggling please use this commands before run 'webpack' in cmd :

(Windows)
SET NODE_ENV=production
or
SET NODE_ENV=development

In production mode we compress and obfuscate code.

## Implementation

I used redux approach for architecture, React Router as platform for routing system,  webpack with React Hot Loader plugin as builder,
